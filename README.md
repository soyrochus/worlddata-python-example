# Worlddata Python Example

A Python package demonstrating the usage with large data sets.

## Installation and activation after obtaining a clone from Github

Install `pipenv`, the modern Python packaging and environment managing tool. For a great guide see: [Pipenv: A Guide to the New Python Packaging Tool](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/). Pipenv solves most of the issues with Python's packaging ecosystem.

Use the more basic package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pipenv.

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Then go into the folder `worlddata-python-example` and execute:

```bash
pipenv install -e .
```
in order to install all dependecies and get a locally registered 'development' copy of the project.
